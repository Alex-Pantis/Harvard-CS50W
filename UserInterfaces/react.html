<!-- 
    1. Imperative Programming
    = You tell the computer EXACTLY HOW to do something, step by step.
    Like giving a robot instructions: 
    "Go forward 2 steps, turn left, pick up box, put box on table"
    
    Example in normal JavaScript (imperative):
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = 'Click me';
    document.body.appendChild(button);
-->

<!-- 
    2. Declarative Programming
    = You tell the computer WHAT you want, not HOW to do it.
    Like ordering food in a restaurant: "I want a pizza with cheese"
    You don't say how to make it — the chef figures it out.
    
    React is DECLARATIVE.
    You say: "I want a button that says Click me"
    React figures out how to create it and update it.
-->

<!-- 
    React = a JavaScript library made by Facebook (now Meta)
    It helps you build user interfaces (buttons, lists, forms) in a declarative way.
    
    Main idea: You write "components" (small reusable pieces of UI)
    React takes your description and shows it on the screen.
    When data changes, React automatically updates only what needs to change.
-->

<!-- 
    React = the brain (knows how to build components)
    ReactDOM = the hands (puts the components into the real HTML page)
    
    You use ReactDOM.render() to show your React app in the browser.
    It finds a <div id="root"></div> in HTML and puts React stuff inside it.
-->

<!-- 
    JSX = JavaScript XML
    It looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript.
    
    You write:
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    
    But it's NOT real HTML — it's JSX syntax.
    Browsers don't understand JSX directly.
    
    Example JSX:
    const element = <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>;
    
    This is easier to read than pure JavaScript createElement calls.
-->

<!-- 
    Babel = a tool that converts modern JavaScript + JSX into old plain JavaScript
    that all browsers understand.
    
    Before Babel:
    <h1>Hello</h1>  ← JSX (browsers don't know this)
    
    After Babel:
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello")  ← plain JS (browsers understand this)
    
    In real React projects, Babel runs automatically.
-->

<!-- 
    - Imperative = tell HOW (step by step)
    - Declarative = tell WHAT (describe the result)
    - React = declarative library for building UI
    - ReactDOM = renders React components to real HTML
    - JSX = HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript (easier to write)
    - Babel = translates JSX + modern JS to plain JS for browsers
    
    You write JSX → Babel converts → React builds → ReactDOM shows on page
